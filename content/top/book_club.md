## Book Club (The Go Programming Language)

#### Tuesdays 12:00pm to 01:00pm - [RSVP](https://www.meetup.com/EUG-Go)

Bring a lunch! Let's discuss some coding exercises found in the book. Don't worry about showing up exactly at noon, grab your lunch first if you need to. We'll start around 12:15 and finish up no latter than 12:50 so that you can get back to work.

Check the comments each week for which exercises we'll be going over. Anyone needing extra help with the exercises or with Go code in general is welcome to stay a bit longer.

If you don't have a copy of the book, visit https://www.gopl.io ... EPUB is
available from
[informIT](http://www.informit.com/store/go-programming-language-9780134190440).

If you've already read the book (or simply don't care to), but would still like to come hang out, we'd be happy to have you.

See you there!
