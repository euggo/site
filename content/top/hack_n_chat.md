## Hack 'N' Chat

#### Last Tuesdays 02:00pm to 09:00pm - [RSVP](https://www.meetup.com/EUG-Go)

Let's meet up for an easygoing hack and chat session. While anything Go-related is greatly encouraged, all languages and projects are welcome (even "none"). There is no formal schedule; Time constraints are loose and expectations are low.

---

We will be at or near the Broadway Commerce Center (probably migrating at some point, and likely folding into Tech Tuesday at The Barn Light). The Meetup Event's comment section will be posted to with relevant details.

*Don't hesitate to use the comment section to suggest a location, find your way, or ask any questions in advance.
