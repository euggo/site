## About Us
All Gophers and curious software professionals are welcome to come discuss Go and related topics.

Go is a Google-funded language for massively-scalable distributed systems that
is statically typed and compiled. It has quickly stabilized and is running
head-to-head with C++, Java, C#, etc. ([The Computer Language Benchmarks Game -
Go](https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/faster/go.html)). However, a larger-than-expected portion of new Gophers is made up of dynamic/interpreted language users who tend to be seeking relief from the cruft in their current languages and/or a more clear future within the horizontally-growing landscape of modern computing.

If you're building web apps, designing APIs, thrive on scalability, or you're simply curious about this fun new(ish) language, let's meetup.
